{"statusCode": 200, "response": "# Incident Report: S3 Bucket Public Read Prohibited\n\n## Incident Summary\n\n**Incident Type:** Non-compliance with the AWS Config rule \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\"\n\n**Incident Description:** The AWS Config rule \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\" has detected that the S3 bucket \"example-bucket\" is non-compliant, allowing public read access.\n\n## Incident Response Process\n\n1. **Acquire, preserve, document evidence:** Retrieve the detailed AWS Config event logs for the non-compliant S3 bucket, including the specific configuration changes and evaluation results.\n2. **Determine the sensitivity, dependency of the resources:** Assess the sensitivity and business criticality of the affected S3 bucket, as well as any downstream dependencies or applications that may be impacted.\n3. **Identify the remediation steps:**\n   - Review the AWS Config rule \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\" and understand the expected configuration for the S3 bucket.\n   - Determine the steps required to remediate the non-compliant configuration and restore the bucket to a compliant state.\n4. **Verify and validate the changes in lower environment:**\n   - Implement the identified remediation steps in a non-production environment to validate the effectiveness and impact of the changes.\n   - Ensure that the S3 bucket is properly configured and no longer allows public read access.\n5. **Confirm with respective application teams:**\n   - Coordinate with the application owners and stakeholders responsible for the affected S3 bucket to ensure that the remediation steps do not disrupt any existing applications or workflows.\n   - Obtain approval from the relevant teams before proceeding with the changes in the production environment.\n6. **Make changes to resolve the incident:**\n   - Implement the verified and validated remediation steps in the production environment to bring the S3 bucket into compliance with the \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\" rule.\n   - Closely monitor the bucket's configuration and the AWS Config evaluation results to ensure the issue is resolved.\n7. **Record history and actions:**\n   - Document all the steps taken during the incident response process, including the timeline, actions, and outcomes.\n   - Maintain a comprehensive record of the incident for future reference and potential auditing purposes.\n8. **Post activity - perform a root cause analysis, update policies if needed:**\n   - Conduct a thorough root cause analysis to understand the underlying reasons for the non-compliant configuration.\n   - Identify any gaps or weaknesses in the existing policies, procedures, or controls that may have contributed to the incident.\n   - Update the relevant policies, guidelines, or training materials to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.\n\nBy following this incident response process, the AWS Security Engineer can effectively address the non-compliant S3 bucket, restore the desired configuration, and implement measures to prevent similar issues from happening again.", "res": [{"doc": {"action": "CheckCompliance", "local-test": true, "event": {"id": "1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab", "detail-type": "Config Rules Compliance Change", "source": "aws.config", "account": "123456789012", "time": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z", "region": "us-west-2", "resources": ["arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"], "detail": {"configRuleName": "s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited", "awsAccountId": "123456789012", "configRuleARN": "arn:aws:config:us-west-2:123456789012:config-rule/config-rule-abcdef", "resourceType": "AWS::S3::Bucket", "resourceId": "example-bucket", "awsRegion": "us-west-2", "newEvaluationResult": {"evaluationResultIdentifier": {"evaluationResultQualifier": {"configRuleName": "s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited", "resourceType": "AWS::S3::Bucket", "resourceId": "example-bucket"}, "orderingTimestamp": "2023-06-15T10:29:55Z"}, "complianceType": "NON_COMPLIANT", "resultRecordedTime": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z", "configRuleInvokedTime": "2023-06-15T10:29:50Z"}, "notificationCreationTime": "2023-06-15T10:30:00Z", "messageType": "ComplianceChangeNotification", "recordVersion": "1.0"}}}, "response": "# Incident Report: S3 Bucket Public Read Prohibited\n\n## Incident Summary\n\n**Incident Type:** Non-compliance with the AWS Config rule \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\"\n\n**Incident Description:** The AWS Config rule \"s3-bucket-public-read-prohibited\" has detected that the S3 bucket \"example-bucket\" is non-compliant, allowing public read access.\n\n## Incident Response Process\n\n1. **Acquire, preserve, document evidence:** Retrieve the detailed AWS Config event logs for the non-compliant S3 bucket, including the specific configuration changes and evaluation results.\n2. **Determine the sensitivity, dependency of the resources:** Assess the sensitivity and business criticality of the affected S3 bucket, as well as any downstream dependencies or applications that may be impacted.\n3. **Identify the remediation steps:**\n   -
